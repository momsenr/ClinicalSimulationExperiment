## Introduction

This repository accompanies the paper "AI-Driven Disease Risk Stratification: Tackling the Challenge of Complex Confounders to Enable Precision-Medicine." This notebook contains all the code and analyses to run the clinical simulation experiment. Additionally, we provide the models and results that were used to generate the dataset in Figure 1 and Extended Data Figure 2.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure that you have the following packages installed:
- python (3.11)
- pytorch (2.0.0)
- cudatoolkit (11.8)
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- torch
- sklearn
- scipy
- pickle
- scikit-learn

For example, to install all dependencies with conda, you can use:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate clinical_simulation
```

After this, start a jupyter notebook session and run ClinicalSimulationExperiment.ipynb.
